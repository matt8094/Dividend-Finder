# Dividend-Finder
Code for finding all possible divisors of a number.

This was one of the first programs that I started with when 
I was first learning Python. It's a very simple concept. You 
enter a number and the program will sort through every
number from 1 to the entered number, and if the division
is clean (meaning that there is no remainder) it will
print out the function for that number.

It was a very easy thing to program it in Python, and since
I am now starting to use Java, it seemed fitting to be the
first thing that I wrote with it. 

I guess I also decided to recode it into C++ just to be 
thorough.
